# 🪩 "Glass Ball Run!" 🪩

## About the project☀️
***Glass Ball Run!*** is simple 2D physics-based platformer game, developed as a final project for uni classes.
The game is mostly intended release on Android, but will also be available on my itch.io.

## Inspirations✨
The biggest inspiration for this game is an old flash game called ***Red ball***. It's a platformer, where the character is a rigid body, making movement a little more challenging. In the original game, there are 17 levels, each one introducing different mechanics, like spinning platforms, slopes, swaying axes, a car, a train and so on.

## Gameplay🕹️
Like in many other platformers, your goal is to pass all levels, by getting from point A to point B without dying.
What's different here from the original game, is that the player has to collect a flag, to unlock the checkpoint and begin the next level. In addition to that, players can also collect coins, with which they will be able to buy customisations. Coins are located in slighlty more challenging places, as they are not necessary for level completion.
